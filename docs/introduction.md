Chapter 1 â€” Introduction & Project Foundation

1.1 What Is NimbusLance?

NimbusLance is a fullstack micro-SaaS application designed to help freelancers manage their clients, projects, estimates, invoices, and payments. Itâ€™s a secure, scalable, modern Progressive Web App (PWA) accessible from both desktop and mobile.

But more than just a business tool, NimbusLance is also a learning platform and a personal challenge. Iâ€™m building it from the ground up with the goal of mastering AWS Cloud, DevOps best practices, and infrastructure-as-code while sharpening my fullstack development skills.

1.2 Who Is This Project For?

This guide is aimed at:

Junior developers looking to build a real-world fullstack SaaS project

Self-taught devs transitioning to DevOps or Cloud Engineering

Freelancers who want to automate their own back office

Anyone interested in deploying a secure, scalable SaaS on AWS

Youâ€™ll follow my steps from scratch, and by the end, youâ€™ll not only understand how NimbusLance works, but also be able to replicate or adapt it to your own needs.
