1️⃣ auth.controller.ts
Purpose:
Handles authentication endpoints (/auth/signup, /auth/signin).
Let’s review the file.

✅ auth.controller.ts Review

Summary:
Exposes /auth/signup and /auth/signin endpoints.
Uses DTO for input validation.
Delegates logic to AuthService.

Best Practices:
Clean, minimal, and correct.
No business logic in the controller.
Uses dependency injection.

Suggestions:
If you want to add API documentation (Swagger), you can use decorators like @ApiTags('auth'), but this is optional.

Next: I’ll review auth.service.ts.

✅ auth.service.ts Review

Summary:
Handles user signup and signin with secure password hashing (bcrypt, 12 rounds).
Uses Prisma for DB access.
Issues JWT tokens with 1-hour expiry.
Handles errors with clear messages.

Best Practices:
Passwords are hashed before storage.
JWT secret is read from environment.
Generic error messages for invalid credentials (prevents user enumeration).
Uses dependency injection for services.


Suggestions for Further Security/Improvements:
Rate Limiting (Optional, for production):
Prevent brute-force attacks on signin.
Can be implemented with a global guard or middleware.
Email Normalization:
Consider normalizing emails to lowercase before storing/comparing.
Account Lockout (Optional, for production):
Lock account after X failed attempts.
Return Consistent Error Messages:
You already do this for signin, which is good.
Token Expiry Config:
Consider making token expiry configurable via env.
Your current implementation is secure and follows best practices for a modern SaaS.


Add Role Guards for Endpoints (user.service.ts)
You can now easily create guards for role-based access:
